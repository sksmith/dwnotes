    - People are going there to clear stuff out and stopped and left

    - [[Dim]] has greasy hair, thick body, thicker head
    - Dim says "It doesn't feel right!"

## Humphrey's Manor

- Weather abruptly changes to stormy and raining
- Upepo wants to stop the rain, but it's sort of out of his league
    - Instead settles on protecting us from the rain

  - Scanning the walls, etc.

    - "What happened here recently?"
        - Place was turned over recently
        - [[Dim]] and others started moving stuff around
        - Place was in dissarray before them, though
        - Previous person left in a hurry
    - "What here is useful or valuable to me?"
        - Myriad of valuable items
            - Nice mirror on the wall with silver inlay
            - Other minorly valuable, some more pocketable than others
    - "What should I be on the lookout for?"
        - As far as you can tell, no immediate dangers
        - Still a bit of an odd feeling, place has a creepy vibe
        - Not an immediate threat
- Upepo goes up the stairs, and starts writhing and yowling
    - Something is going on with them
    - Jaxon persues
    - Upepo has ringing in their ears, hard to tell where it's coming from
    - Upepo pops out of cat form, ringing fades but is still noticable
- Upepo opens a door searching for the ringing
    - Seems to be a study
    - Ringing is a little strong here
- Skreedle wants to see if this is magical in nature
    - Weaves a spell to detect magic in the area
    - Notices a faint magical effect eminating from a wall in the room
    - Magic in the area makes him feel ill
- Jaxon shoulder checks the wall and falls into a pit w/ tunnel

## Tunnel Under the Manor

- Skreedle follows down on the ladder, as does Upepo
- Long tunnel underneath the building, Renny leads the way
- Tunnel seems to head away from the town
- Becomes less carved stone, more natural stone
- Come to an opening with ambient light

- Deep pools of water and puddles
- Can hear cave critters
- Upepo investigates the moss, looks similar but has unique properties
- Cavern leads to another tunnel

## Crystal Frogs

    - Size of dogs
    - Upepo feels like they're hollowed out
- Frog shoots a crystaline tongue out and grabs upepo by the arm
- Upepo tries to turn into a bass
- More frogs begin to pop up out of the water
- Crystals on them seem to be moving
- Reny draws her rapier as a frog lashes at her with its tongue
    - She tries to duck out of the way, but the frog grabs her sword
- Upepo tries to leap out of the pond to change shape, grab Reny's rapier and flee
    - Frog smashes him
- Jaxon rushes toward Upepo with his shield up, and grabs him
    - A frog leaps at them, lands on top of Jaxon's shield and bites him
- Reny grabs the sword and tries to flee
    - Successfully grabs the sword, rushes toward the tunnel away

    - His life energy leaches out and he can't deliver it to Skreedle

    - Struck with unnaturality of the water spirit, it notices him
- We manage to flee, further down the tunnel we come to a door
- Reny opens the door

## Cave Study

- The door leads to a study with cavernous walls
- Rotting corpse here (we realize later it's Humphrey)
    - Has some crystals forming on him
    - Killed likely by lacerations, maybe a scrap
- Skreedle speaks to the corpse
    - Jim - "What does it look like?"
        - Spirit lifts up out of the body
        - Speaks with weirdo cryptic way of speaking
    - Spirit - "Not me? Not me! Can't be me!" - looks distressed
    - Skreedle - "Why would you not want to be chosen?"
    - Spirit - "Wasn't chosen, not me, wasn't me! Can't be me!"
    - Jim - It appears to have growths
    - Skreedle - What are the growths?
    - Spirit - "Comes from the conduit, can't be me!
- Jaxon gives the location a good look over
    - "Who or what is really in control here?"
        - We seem to be in control here
    - "What kind of books and papers are in this study?"
        - Books
            - Arcane
            - Mythology
            - Music Theory
        - Journal
            - References to the conduit
            - Stuff about crystals and crystaline growth
            - Mentions of [[The Void]]
        - The Void
            - Skreedle has heard about it in his studies
            - Forbidden knowledge
            - Not taught because we don't want people to interact with it
            - Another plane or dimension
            - Dark energy, or the absence of energy
            - Dangerous
            - Seems like the conduit is connected to the void
            - Conduit should be bringing this energy into the world
            - Creating a connection that isn't supposed to be there
- THE CORPSE IS HUMPHREY!
- Upepo reaches out for anything natural
    - Something here is messing with the natural order
- Reny notices that Humphrey has a nice looking amethyst ring
    - Decides against it because it's totally gonna be cursed
- Upepo heals himself, it's hot garbage
- Reny approaches the next door and listens
    - Hears running water
    - Feels faint vibrations when she presses against the door
    - Checks the door for traps, doesn't find anything
- Reny opens the door
    - Short tunnel, opens up into a larger room

## Conduit Room

- Land path in a massive cavern
- Path is over a basin filled with water, several hundred feet long
- Leads to an island toward the back with a pedastal with crystals on it
- Crystals in the water surrounding the land bridge
- Crystals nearest to the conduit glow brighter
- Reny tries to get a sense of dangerous
    - No ambush or trap here
- Skreedle - "Is this pedistal natural?" - No
    - "In the books, did this appear to be made or natural?"
    - Jim - "It was unclear to Humphrey"
- Reny - does this seem like a natural formation of rock?
    - "It doesn't seem to be man made at all, maybe the doors were added after"
    - "Were the doors made to hide this, or protect against it?"
- Upepo - "Someone must have covered this up, because the doors were all closed"
- The crystal seems to be emanating on some frequency
- Skreedle attempts to probe the crystal with magic
    - "What here is useful or valuable to me?"
        - After scanning through Humphrey's book, and seeing how this is generating a tone
            something about this thing that is creating this tone, is how it actually affects the
            environment
        - Now that you've made that connection, you remember seeing a set of tuning forks in the
            other room. You might be able to interact with it with the tuning forks
        - It seems like, he was studying it and something unexpected happened
    - "What here is not what it appears to be?"
        - There are also smaller and smoother gems around the area. Those seem to be innert. They
            seem like they might be valuable.
- Upepo - it seems like the crystals reproduce and continue to expand the influence (might not be
    canon but sounds reasonable)
- Reny - what is our goal here? Are we going to retreat from it? Should we try to destroy it?
- We returned to the corpse, got tuning forks off of him, found one off to the side
- In the jounal
    - He made notes of doing experiments with tones and such
    - One of the tones seemed to have a jarring affect on the stone
- Skreedle strikes the tuning fork, holds it to the crystal
    - Seems to be making destructive interference
- He then tries another fork, doesn't do much
- Jaxon touches the canceling fork to the crystal, it gets stronger, he pulls back
- Some kind of Chimera pops out of the water!!! AHHH
    - L: Snake, R: Crystal Neck Cow, M: Chicken
    - Bipedal, but warped
- Upepo (as an owl) - rushes at the creature and scratches its snake eyes
- Charlette - shoots her bow at the creature and strikes!
- After slaying the creature
    - Upepo holds the tuning fork against the crystal, destroying it

## Jaxon's Description

*A tall man with shoulders as wide as a doorframe. His board chin has a deep groove gashed in one 
side with an old scar. His heavy hands make his drawn sword look small. He has beedy eyes that peer 
out from underneath a spanghelm. He carries a heavy round wooden shield rimmed in battered iron.*

### Without the helmet

*Tightly curled red hair hang matted sweaty on his jutting brow.*
